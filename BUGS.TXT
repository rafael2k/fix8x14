  (*) There seems to be an incompatibility between DIAG8X14 and some ATI
      driver versions for Microsoft Windows 2000. We already changed DIAG8X14
      drastically, but still no luck. Please do not blame us, as we do not use
      any illegal graphics cards functions in DIAG8X14! Blame ATI for their
      EGA/VGA emulation instead!
