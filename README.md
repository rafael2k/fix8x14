Description

On the recommendation of the VESA committee many producers of graphics cards removed the 8x14 font from their graphics cards BIOS' to gain more space to implement the latest VBE functions. But there is still some software that relies an that font. To restore such a font, these companies developed several "Terminate & Stay Resident" utilities.

FIX8X14 is the first 8x14 font-fixing implementation as a true device driver, that can be loaded BEFORE ALL other DOS programs which perhaps use an 8x14 font. In addition to the device driver we developed a TSR to achieve maximum customer satisfaction.

To test whether your computer system requires FIX8X14 or not, we developed DIAG8X14. It analyzes your computer with its own algorithm and allows visual inspection too.
